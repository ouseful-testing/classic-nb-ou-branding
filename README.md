```
pip install --upgrade  git+https://github.com/ouseful-testing/classic-nb-ou-branding.git
```

To install the custom branding pack into the `nbclassic` customisation path:

```
ou_nb_branding install
```

In a conda env, run:

```
ou_nb_branding install --conda ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

The `ENVIRONMENT_NAME` is the name of the conda envt you want to install into if you installed and are running the jupyter server in the env; In M348 defaults , this means running:
 
`ou_nb_branding install --conda r_env`
 
Getting the path to install into is a hack, so it may break (I only tested on Mac; repo is at: https://github.com/ouseful-testing/classic-nb-ou-branding )...
 
Without the `--conda` switch, the installation defaults to whatever home Jupyter environment path is found. So in a simple envt, eg the TM358 (not tested) environment, just run:
 
`ou_nb_branding install`
 
For JupyterLab (not tested in the new notebook UI ), hereâ€™s another branding hack: https://github.com/innovationOUtside/jupyterlab_ou_brand_extension
